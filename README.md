# Teacher-Student Quiz Program
A program that Read and Write .txt file.

Contains struct that contains student name,number and score.

so there are two program:
Student Program -> produces .txt file, contains numbers that contains their student number and their answer (as integers).

Teacher Program -> Read .txt file and then put the code inside into a struct and then put their scores in the .txt file.

in this program there are only 3 students:
Edgar, Student number = 123.
Refan, Student number = 321.
Andre, Student number = 213.

Collabortive Assigment Task Division:

Student by Edgar (+ Encrypted answer by refan).
Decrypt by Refan.
Teacher by Edgar.


However, this program still have weakness, such as the student could just copy paste their friend's answer. to anticipate that, in the future i will add more feature such as secret code on the .txt file, so that a student could only answer through the progtam given by the teacher.
